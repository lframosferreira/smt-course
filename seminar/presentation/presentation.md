# What is Z3-Noodler

- Fork of the Z3 theorem prover
- String theory solver replaced by *Noodler*
  - *Stabilization-based procedure*
  - Heavy usage of *non deterministic automata*

---

# Handling automata and regular expressions

- Hard task
- Mata library
  - Union, concatenation, intersection, etc
- Very efficient and optimized

---

# Architecture

- Takes advatnge of Z3's whole DPLL($$\mathcal{T}$$) architecture
- Parser, rewriter and LIA solver
